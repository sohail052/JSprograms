## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. It can dynamically modify content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is essential for front-end web development.

## Basic Syntax

Let's start with a simple example. Below is a basic JavaScript code snippet that displays a message in the browser console:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript comment
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
```

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript uses variables to store data. Here's an example of declaring and using variables:

```javascript
// Declaring variables
let name = "John";
let age = 30;
let isStudent = false;

// Displaying variable values
console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Is Student?", isStudent);
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code. Here's an example of defining and calling a function:

```javascript
// Defining a function
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Calling the function
let message = greet("Alice");
console.log(message);
```
