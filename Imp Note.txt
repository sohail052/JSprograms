Always rememebar that, we will not tend to apply any condition with [else] which comes in the last of if-else condtion.
Because pattern already follows the conditons on first 2 cases and last else has to execute with something different than provided conditions:

if (condition 1) {
    do this thing;
  }

else if (condition 2) {
   do that thing;
  }

else { do something different than condition 1 and 2 }    // no need to insert braces () or any condition in last "else" section..
